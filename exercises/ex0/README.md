# Preparation

In order to participate in this hands-on session, you MUST have installed the latest version of Eclipse and the latest version of the ABAP Development Tools (ADT) in Eclipse. Please check the following two short documents on how to if you have not already done it:

1. Install ABAP Development Tools (ADT)
2. Adapt the Web Browser settings in your ADT installation
You also need a user on an SAP S/4HANA Cloud/On Premise ABAP system.

Let's start the excercise and see whether everything is ready to go. Please make sure you have all the necessary prerequsistes listed below. If not, please raise your voice during the sesion so that the speakers can assist you early in the session.

## Prerequisites
1.	Installation of the ABAP Development Tools (ADT): Go to this tutorial and carry out the steps of [Install ABAP Development Tools (ADT)](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/abap-install-adt.html) , you don't need to do the "Install abapGit plugin" part.

2.	Adapt the Web Browser settings in your ADT installation
   	*	In Eclipse, choose the menu bar **Window** > **Preferences**.
   	*	Enter '**Web Browser**' in the search field.
   	*	Activate the radio button Use external web browser.
   	*	Select one of the listed external web browsers that are available, e.g. your Default system web browser (Please make sure that Internet Explorer is NOT selected).

3.	You also need a user on an SAP S/4HANA OnPremise ABAP  system.

	Note for participants of SAP events: You will recieve logon information (User and
	Password ) from the hosts during the event.
	In almost every chapter of this tutorial there is a reference to a number ###, so a 	3digit number. Make sure that this number was assigend to you by the moderators / 		speakers of this course and remember it well. It is important as we will use these 		numbers, where every user has a different one, in order to create different names 		for applications and other artefact. As we will deploy all the the artefacts to the 	same SAP S/4HANA OnPremise system, it is important that they all differ in the 			names and identifiers, so there are no clashes

If you don't have access to the SAP S/4HANA OnPremise system with your user and password or if you don't know your number, please let the speakers know.


## Summary

Now that you have installed ADT with the necessary browser settings and also have users on an SAP S/4HANA OnPrem system.
