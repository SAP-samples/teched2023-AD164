# Preparation

In order to participate in this hands-on session, you MUST have installed the latest version of Eclipse and the latest version of the ABAP Development Tools (ADT) in Eclipse. Please check the following two short documents on how to if you have not already done it:

1. Install ABAP Development Tools (ADT)
2. Adapt the Web Browser settings in your ADT installation
You also need a user on an SAP S/4HANA Cloud/On Premise ABAP system.

Let's start the exercise and see whether everything is ready to go. Please make sure you have all the necessary prerequisites listed below. If not, please let the speakers/hosts know during the session so that the we can assist you early in the session.

## Prerequisites
1.	Installation of the ABAP Development Tools (ADT): Go to this tutorial and carry out the steps of [Install ABAP Development Tools (ADT)](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/abap-install-adt.html) , you don't need to do the "Install abapGit plugin" part.

2.	Adapt the Web Browser settings in your ADT installation
   	*	In Eclipse, choose the menu bar **Window** > **Preferences**.
   	*	Enter **Web Browser** in the search field.
   	*	Activate the radio button **Use external web browser**.
   	*	Select one of the listed external web browsers that are available, e.g. your Default system web browser (Please make sure that Internet Explorer is NOT selected).

3.	You also need a user on an SAP S/4HANA OnPremise ABAP system.

	Note for participants of SAP events: You will receive the logon information (User and Password ) from the hosts during the event.
	
 In almost every chapter of this tutorial there is a reference to a number ###, a 3 digit number. Make sure that this number ( which is unique ) was assigned to you by the moderators / speakers of this course and remember it well. 

 It is important to use this number in order to create different names for applications and other artefacts. Having this unique number as a suffix for the names of the artefacts is mandatory since we will deploy all the artefacts to the same SAP S/4HANA OnPremise system, it is important that they all differ in the names and identifiers and thereby avoid any clashes in the names.

If you don't have access to the SAP S/4HANA OnPremise system with your user and password or if you don't know your number, please let the speakers know.


## Summary

Now that you have installed ADT with the necessary browser settings and also have users on an SAP S/4HANA OnPrem system.
